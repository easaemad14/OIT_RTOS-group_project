Content of Report : Function prototypes and general notes

taskControl :	//created on system boot, relays 'outside' user input to the elevator
	
	initUART();	//create UART task and initialize it
	initCLI();	//create / init CLI
	initQueue();	//possibly use a queue for myself to handle input cases
			//NOTE:  I am not sure where keypress gets debounced - I assume in CLI/UART?
	initElevator();	//create elevator task

	while(1) {	//NOTE:  Should I get rid of this and just put all that init stuff above in our 				//main file?
		checkCLI();	//check for CLI input
		checkUART();	//check for UART input
		
		if (CLI.input == ES) { //emergency stop gets top priority
			//output some message here?
			elevator.move(emergency_stop);	//tell elevator to execute emergency stop
		else
			switch (user_input) {
				case some_input:
					//output some message here?
					elevator.move(valid_user_input); //handle a normal call
				default:
					elevator.move(no_calls); //idle mode for elevator
			}
		}

//NOTE:  It would be cool to ENUM the locations for elevator to move to, so its easier to pass commands
