SUBJECT: Week 2 Progress of Term Project

Progress of the Wilsonville Team on the term project is at the moment off to a slow start. Each team member is in the brainstorming phase and discussing with other team members the
interaction of our individual portions of the project with that of the modules being develpoped by the other members. However, labs for each team memebr are being worked on concurrently with the group project and so labor is spread thin across these tasks. Following the weekend we are hoping to gather momentum.

Any additional files reflecting current work will be included in the folder containing this memo as well.
