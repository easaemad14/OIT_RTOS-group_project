This contains the general overview of each team members responsibilities for
the project, categorized in a human understandable fashion, which doesn't 
necessarily represent any given FreeRTOS task, structure, or file. Please see
the "Author" field at the top of each source and header file for clarification
if you care for a more specific definition.


Controllers - Charles:
    There are several elevator controllers (e.g. CLI, UART, etc.) that will be
    defined as FreeRTOS tasks. These will simulate user control from a floor
    level, emergency controls (from outside of an elevator), and elevator
    parameter setting.

Elevator - Steven:
    The elevator will be implemented as a singleton FreeRTOS task, however is
    responsible for spawning additional tasks as needed and controlling 
    peripherals such as LEDs. The logic behind the elevator is complicated and
    is a large task within itself.

Structural support - Easa:
    All of the work listed above requires function calls to initialize and
    drive hardware, as well as segregation from each other component. Easa
    will be in charge of designing the files and supporting the work of all
    team members.
