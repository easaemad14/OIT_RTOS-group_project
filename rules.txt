The following are the general rules and guidelines for project development
and implementation. Draconian code formatting standards emphasize form over 
function; that's messed up. The following standards are MPLab IDE defaults:

1. Right margin is set to 80; try not to write lines longer than this.
 a.There are obviously exceptions to this, such as URIs
 b. Indent by four columns and TABs are four spaces

2. All braces for function declarations are on their own line (this is not
    the default, but matches common standard)
 a. If you need a scope within a case statement (to combat a cross-
    initialization), they go on their own line to maintain block formatting.
    This is also not the default.
 b. All other braces are on the same line.
 c. Use general rule of thumb for readability: if you think it should have
    parentheses around logic, include it. If you are in doubt include
    parentheses.

3. There is no need for spaces after any form control

4.  There is no such thing as self-documenting code.
 a. Every function should contain a comment for what that function does.
 b. If the function returns a type, denote what each case represents.
